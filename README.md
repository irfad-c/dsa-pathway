# DSA Pathway — Irfad C

This repo tracks my DSA learning journey: problem solutions, notes, and small projects.

## Roadmap

- Arrays & Strings ✅
- Two Pointers ✅
- Recursion & Backtracking ✅
- Graphs, Trees, BFS/DFS
- Dynamic Programming

## How to run

Each problem folder contains a solution and tests. Run `node problems/array/001-two-sum/test.js`.

## Highlights

- `projects/maze-solver` — visual DFS/BFS demo (live on GitHub Pages)
- `problems/dp/` — memoized and tabulation approaches with complexity notes
